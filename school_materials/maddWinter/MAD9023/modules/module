PHP

variables:  a dollar-sign ($) directly followed by the variable name.
    $name = "Jon";

    $name = "Seb";  //string
    $age = 112;  //number
    $alive = false;  //boolean
    $friends = array("Eric", "Lisa", "Tom", "Anna");

Strings
    // php is to help create web content and therefore has some useful functionality to manipulate text string data.

    . works as + when it comes to binding strings
        $fullname = "Jimbo" . " " . "Jones";
        // var fullname = "Jimbo" + " " + "Jones"; in javascript

    "" and '' do different things.

        echo "<p>Your teacher is " . $teacher . "</p>";
            // <p>Your teacher is Albert Einstein</p>
            // echoing out" content

        echo "<p>Your teacher is $teacher</p>";
            // <p>Your teacher is Albert Einstein</p>

        echo '<p>Your teacher is ' . $teacher . '</p>';
            // <p>Your teacher is Albert Einstein</p>

        echo '<p>Your teacher is $teacher</p>';
            // <p>Your teacher is $teacher</p>

    Double and single quotes do different things: if you place a variable name like $fullname inside double quotes, the PHP interpreter will recognize it as a variable; if you place the same variable inside single quotes, PHP will ignore the variable and see it as just text.
