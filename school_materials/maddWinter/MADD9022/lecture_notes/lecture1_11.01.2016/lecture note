if(statement) is to check
    either 0 or !0
        >> if it exists or it doesn't exist

if()
    obj == undefined

try {

}


    ex)
        //var mol = 42;
        //var result = func(mol);

        // func does not exist

        try{
            //do something
            var mol = 42;
            var result = func(mol);

            if(result > 0)
                doA();
            else
                doB(); // this is shortcut if there is only one line.
                       // If professionally written, not recommended
                       // because if someone writes something on top of it and forget to put {},
                       // then it goes wrong.
        }
        catch(e) {
            console.log("Name: " + e.name + " Message: " + e.message);
            console.log(e);
        }

        //message is better for debugging
        // name property is the error type

// the point is that the website is still working even if my code goes wrong at some part.
// any file operation will use try and catch block because any of it can fail.
