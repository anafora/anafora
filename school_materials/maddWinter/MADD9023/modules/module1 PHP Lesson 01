Module 1 - PHP Lesson 01

  Introduction to PHP

    PHP: a server-side programming language that allows you to develop applications on a web server
         that are able to dynamically deliver content to a web browser or mobile application.
         // a site can use an index.php file instead of index.html

    Using index.html - the server responds by sedning the single static index.html to the client's browser
                      to be viewed when the client makes a request for your index.html

    Using index.php  - you can choose to write blocks of logic that will determine what content is shown
                      dynamically, every time the file is requested.

                      With a request from a client to the URL hosting your php file, the host server executes
                      the code in your php file.

                          >> when different users access to your index.php, they can be
                             served content unique to their experience at that time.

    Every block of PHP code must be wrapped inside of <?php and ?>

        your PHP page requested > from top to bottom,
                                  the server 1. runs through the php file,
                                             2. compiles the response,
                                             3. sends it back to the client

                                  PHP is mostly used to build web pages

                                  // PHP builds the (HTML) response on the server before it is
                                     sent to the client's browser to be interpreted as HTML.

        To contain HTML code,

            HTML has to be written outside of the PHP code blocks
                      ex)
                        <?php
                            echo "<p>Hello World</p>";
                        ?>
                or

            Within the PHP code blocks, use echo() function to write html

    Similarity with Javascript - creating new HTML contents by using Javascript.

          the difference: the PHP code to create the “Hello world” paragraph occurs on the web server
                          before the page ever gets seen by the browser.

                          Javascript runs locally in the browser after the page would have been loaded.

                       - Using static .html, .htm, .js, and .css files,
                                the web server receives a request for a page
                                and immediately sends back those specific files to the browser.
                                Each time you load that URL, you will get the exact same response.

                       - With PHP and (as with other server-side languages),
                                the web server runs your PHP script, and uses the logic within it
                                to determine what the response is. PHP lets you generate a response
                                containing whatever content you would like.

                       In this class you will learn how to generate these unique responses to clients
                       using a mixture of HTML, CSS and Javascript to assemble the content within the browser
                       each time the request is made to the URL.

        PHP is a server-side scripting language

        it is not available to view on the website by right click.
        it has a very extensive documentation

        able to combine php with database system (using mySQL)


*** Ensure Error Reporting is on

        error in php code
            the only way to know what went wrong on the server
             >> to have php output the error message to the browser.

             // WAMP usually has this feature on, but MAMP doesn't do so by default

                /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php[newest version number]/conf/php.ini.
                >> Near line 280, change display_errors from Off to On, save the file, and close it.
                   Fully restart MAMP


Module 2 - PHP Lesson 02

    Housekeeping

    // the only way to execute PHP script is to load it from a php-enabled web server.

    root folder in MAMP: /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/

        1. create a path: /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/MAD9023/L02
        2. create a new html file. // index.php

            <!DOCTYPE HTML>
            <html>
            <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <title>Untitled Document</title>
            </head>

            <body>
            <?php

                echo "<p>Hello World</p>\n";

            ?>    // echo has injected <p> when the source code is viewed in the console
            </body>
            </html>


    The phpinfo() function and the php.ini file location

        phpinfo() function
            : this function displays the information for php installation.

            <?php
            phpinfo();
            > // standard notation to call the function.
              // you must not have this line in your php code for your website >> it can ruin your computer(security).




        php.ini file
            : php configuration file
                ';' as an end of a line // somewhat used to commenting out



            // a lot of problems you will face may come down in the php.ini file

            the path to the php.ini file will be stored on your machine
                                        at /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php[newest version number]/conf/ in MAMP
