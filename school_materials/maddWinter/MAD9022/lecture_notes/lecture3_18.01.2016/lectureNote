Javasctript to create video element and video player.

ve.canPlayType(mp4);
>> "maybe"(<50%), "probably"(>50%), ""

  if "", it's not going to play.

  if "maybe" and "probably"?,





 rate: speed
 volume: 0<x<1
 // be careful, not violating the range

mp4 goes with every browser but in case of an old browser, use webm

ev.preventDefault();

// some event handlers have default events. For good coding practice,


text.indexOf("Some Text") = 5

if not possible to find it, then it returns -1
