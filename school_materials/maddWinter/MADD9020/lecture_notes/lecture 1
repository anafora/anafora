    What is design?

            post-its
                art = design? // "disagreed"

                design is solving a problem for someone. However, art is expression.
                // don't think that design is something to do with my product

        Design is the rendering of intent

            - the architect designed the house
                // the designer doesn't build the house
                // but it defines what builders intent to build

            - the urban planner designed the neighbourhood
            - the engineer designed the experiment
            - the graphic artist designed the poster

        Design is problem solving

            "You really have to figure out what you are solving."

                - Learn: listen, ask questions, observe
                - Define: articulate problems and opportunities based on what you learned
                            // defining whose problems you are going to be solving
                - Innovate: generate ideas & solutions that address user needs. No boundaries!
                                                       that might solve the problems
                - Build: create something that lets you show/demonstrate one or more ideas
                - Validate: test design with users. Find out how it meets their needs.

            User needs = problem to be solved
            Technology = how you will solve it
                        ex) Africa may lack available techs
                // those two are our focus

            business = why you are going to bother solving it


            user. technology. business
              |         |         |
              |         |         |


              >> useful, usable, desirable product

    what isn't design?

        decoration
        how it looks
        art
        surface deep
        picking the right colours
        // all these bullshits

    why mobile?

        Because I know "my users have a need, that my product/service
        can deliver as well (or better) on a mobile device"

            "MY USERS HAVE A NEED, THAT MY PRODUCT/SERVICE CAN
            DELIVER AS WELL (OR BETTER) ON A MOBILE DEVICE"

                How do you know that?
                • Real research, with real users.
                • A well-defined business value proposition.
                • A solid understanding of mobile technology & capability.

    what do mobile users want?

        That depends…
        • Sometimes, they want all the same features/services as they
        use on a desktop
        • Sometimes, they want a sub-set of those features, that are
        more applicable to a mobile context
        • Sometimes, they want one or more entirely different,
        mobile-specific features

        ex) BMO website
