Asynchronous: more than one at a time
    what's happening outside of the javascript.

    Within the Browser

    JS Engine - exists outside
    Rendering Engine
    HTTP Request

    Event Queue

    When the stack is finished, it looks for the Event Queue.

    Browser asynchronously putting things into the event queue.

        ex)

        function waitThreeSeconds() {
            var ms = 3000 + new Date().getTime();
            while (new Date() < ms){}
            console.log('finished function');
        }

        function clickHandler() {
            console.log('click event!');
        }

        document.addEventListener('click', clickHandler);

        waitThreeSeconds();
        console.log('finished execution');


    Javascript won't start looking at the events until the stack is finished.
